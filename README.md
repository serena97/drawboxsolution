# Draw Box Solution

The method `makebox` takes in a width (w) and height (h), and draws a box of size w by h. 

## Setting up 

Make sure you have Intellij, JDK 1.8 and Junit 4 on your computer. Open the project in Intellij, then compile and run the Main class under the file directory `src`. You will be asked for width and height inputs. If valid width and height inputs are entered, the program will draw the box on the terminal. 
Regarding tests, run `MainTest.java` in the same file directory.
